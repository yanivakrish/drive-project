In order to run the project you need to clone this repository and then:

1. Run in your terminal/cmd `npm install` to install dependencies used by the client.

2. Navigate using `cd` to `apps/server` and run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` to install dependencies used by the server.

3. From the root folder, run `npx nx serve client` in order to run the client.

4. From the `apps/server` folder, run `py ./server.py` or `pyhon ./server.py` in order to run the server.

5. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and the `MongoDB Compass` is running so the server will be able to interact with the database.

You're Done!!!
